Now we have the application with Jade and Express JS installed.
There are RESTful calls: a PUT call to enter a new record into the data structure, and particularly a GET to list all JSON records stored in the data module.

Installation

	npm install

Run the application
-------------------------------

	node app.js

Request examples
